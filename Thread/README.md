|Implement Round Robin scheduling	|Completed|
|Record performance of both scheduling	|Incomplete|

In terms of do_create(), do_kill(), do_suspend(), and do_resume(), FIFO and RR are basically the same. The differences resides in the dispatch operation.

# Customized output:

In Log: Search for "My" or "XXL" notation, XXL is our group signature.
